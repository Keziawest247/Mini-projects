# Mini project - A Higher & Lower Guessing Game

This program enables users to select a difficulty level by specifying the range of numbers for the game. 
It generates a random number within this range and prompts the user to guess the number in a loop. 
After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. 
The total number of guesses is tracked, and once the game concludes, 
a summary of the game is recorded in a text file along with the current date and time.
